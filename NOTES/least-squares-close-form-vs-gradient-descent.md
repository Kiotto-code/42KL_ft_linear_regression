You're asking a fantastic and very insightful question — whether the **gradient descent equations** and the **least squares formulas** are "the same." Let’s break this down clearly.

### 🧠 Are They the Same?

**They are based on the *same idea* — minimizing squared error — but they are NOT the same in how they are used or computed.**

---

## 🔁 Comparing the Two

### 📌 1. **Least Squares Closed-form (Analytical)**

From your **first image**:

$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
\quad \text{(slope)}
$$

$$
\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}
\quad \text{(intercept)}
$$

* ✅ Direct formula
* ✅ Exact solution
* ❌ Only works for linear models, with invertible matrices

---

### 📌 2. **Gradient Descent (Iterative Optimization)**

From your **second image**:

$$
\frac{\partial J}{\partial w} = -\frac{2}{n} \sum x_i (y_i - (wx_i + b)) \\
\frac{\partial J}{\partial b} = -\frac{2}{n} \sum (y_i - (wx_i + b))
$$

Update rules:

$$
w := w - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial J}{\partial w} \\
b := b - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial J}{\partial b}
$$

* ✅ Uses **the same loss function** (Mean Squared Error)
* ❌ Doesn’t give exact result immediately — needs iterations
* ✅ Works in more complex scenarios (big data, non-linearity, neural nets)

## 🎯 What's the Key Difference?

| Feature  | Least Squares                        | Gradient Descent                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Method   | Analytical (exact)                   | Numerical (iterative)                        |
| Output   | Direct solution $(\hat{w}, \hat{b})$ | Approximation of $(w, b)$                    |
| Use case | Simple linear models                 | Large-scale or complex models                |
| Based on | Minimizing squared error             | Minimizing same squared error (via gradient) |

### ✅ So: Are They the Same?

**The cost function is the same.**
**The formulas for solving are different.**

> Think of it like this:
>
> 🧮 **Least Squares** is like solving an equation on paper.
> 🏃 **Gradient Descent** is like guessing and adjusting repeatedly until you're close to the right answer.
